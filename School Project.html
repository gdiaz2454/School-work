    <td><p style="text-align:justify">I’ve had a love and passion for shoes since a kid. My first pair of shoes were Nike Air Jordans. I later on started buying Jordans in which I collected until the age of 18. Growing up in Chicago, you have to own atleast 1 pair of Jordans. Now you can’t always buy limited edition shoes like retro Jordans in stores without a ticket so If you don’t get one expect to pay more than retail. Thats why I attend sneaker con the biggest shoe convention in the world. There is also tons of cool apps that  you are able to trade, buy, and sell shoes on. One day I’ll make my own shoe app from code.</p>

    <td><p style="text-align:justify">One of my biggest time consumers growing up was playing various game consoles. It started with Gameboys and I eventually worked my way up to playstation consoles. I loved playing call of duty games up until they got all futuristic. They recently released the a lot of new games which makes me want to start gaming again! Video games exposed me to coding because I wondered how they were made. In the future maybe I’ll get hired to code the next big Cod or GTA.</p></td>

     <td>       <h2>Music</h2>
        <p style="text-align:justify">When it comes to music I’m not your typical listener. I like to listen to <b>all</b> music no matter who made it or what genre! I can listen to anything from old classics with Bill Withers or Ray Charles to new school Hip-Hop/Rap with Lil Uzi-Vert or Kodak Black. My #1 rule is to always give music a chance because you never know if you’ll like it if you don’t listen to it. In todays music culture people often get famous from Soundcloud, Worldstar Hiphop, and of course youtube. All of which were created by code and made into apps or websites. Let me know below whats your favorite site or app to listen to music through.

     <p style="text-align:justify">Coding is in everybody’s life. We use it everyday and some us don’t even know it! For years I had no clue that all of my hobbies are made of one code language or another. When I learned coding had to do with creating video games, apps, and websites it intrigued me. I started to search up game design and along with that came software development. When I learned about developing and watched a few videos on what they do, I wanted to become one. I want to build, innovate, and problem solve the futures technology!
